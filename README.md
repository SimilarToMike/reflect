# Reflect
---
## Application Description
---
The core idea of Reflect was to create a digital journal with visual progression features. An application that could collect thoughts through and store them in a database where they can be retrieved and looked at in an instance. Allowing users to take advantage of mindfulness and benefits of journaling while never losing or running out of room. 

## Technical Description
Reflect was built as a simple MERN stack application with CRUD features and in time adding auth features. Designed on VSCode and using libraries such as MaterialUI and Redux to further improve site. MERN stands for: MongoDb, Express.js, React and Node.js. The core sturcture of Reflect. Other libraries needed to complete the project included; axios, redux-thunk, moment, react-file-base-64 and MaterialUI libraries. Redux helped keep the application behaving consistently, running in different environments (client, server, and native), and makes things easily testable. Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.


## Tech

My MERN Stack application "Reflect" uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) - Comprehensive UI design libraries for MERN stack applications
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) - fast node.js network app framework 
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) - Efficent backend database structure
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) - Consistency between diiferent environments
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser
